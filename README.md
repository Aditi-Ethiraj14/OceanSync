*OceanSync* is an application that allows users to *report incidents on the sea shore* in real-time, such as drowning cases, oil spills, or other emergencies. Users can capture images, add descriptions, and upload incidents, which are then directed to the relevant authorities via the *API server* for prompt action. Authorities respond *according to the priority* of the alerts.
