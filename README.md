Platform Node.js Supabase HTML CSS JavaScript VS Code License
OceanSync is a web application that allows users to report incidents on the sea shore in real-time, such as drowning cases, oil spills, or other emergencies. Users can capture images, add descriptions, and upload incidents, which are then directed to the relevant authorities via the API server for prompt action. Authorities respond according to the priority of the alerts.
